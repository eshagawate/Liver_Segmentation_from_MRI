## Introduction

Liver diseases are among the most fatal diseases.

The process of segmentation is done on Computer Tomography (CT) Images or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 

Due to the close proximity of the liver to other organs, it is difficult to segment it.

The automatic segmentation of liver in MRI images is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases.
